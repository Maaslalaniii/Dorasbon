# DORSBON
 A healthy work-life balance is vital to the productivity and happiness of employees. However, if you work with a laptop or computer, you probably know the back, neck, and shoulder pain that comes with it, especially if you’re a programmer! This pain often results from sitting with poor posture. Many people tend to hunch or slouch over their laptop while working. This is where DORSBON comes in. DORSBON, an amalgamation of the latin words for “good” and “back”, is a software program that uses computer vision, image recognition, and machine learning to help you fix your posture. This software essentially tracks the depth of the user’s eyes. When the software first starts up, the user calibrates this depth by sitting up straight with good posture through the webcam. Then, when the user slouches and their eyes are closer to the webcam, the computer detects this and sends out a notification, prompting the user to adjust their posture. Once the user adjusts their posture back to the original, perfect posture, the program will then notify the user that they are no longer slouching. A break timer reminds users to take a 5 minute breaker once every hour. With DORSBON, we are hoping to create a healthier work environment for anyone that spends time in front of the computer.
